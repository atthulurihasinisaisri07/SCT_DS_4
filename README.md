🚦 Task 04 – Traffic Accident Data Analysis
📌 Objective

The objective of this task is to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:

🌧 Weather conditions

🛣 Road conditions

⏰ Time of day

📍 Accident hotspots

The goal is to uncover contributing factors and visualize high-risk conditions.

📂 Dataset Used

US Accidents Dataset (March 2023 Version)

Notebook File: Task 4.ipynb

The dataset includes features such as:

Start_Time

Weather_Condition

Severity

Start_Lat

Start_Lng

Road-related attributes

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

🔧 Data Preparation

Loaded large dataset efficiently using row sampling.

Converted Start_Time to datetime format.

Extracted Hour feature for time-based analysis.

Removed missing values where necessary.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

The following analyses were performed:

1️⃣ Weather Condition Analysis

Identified top weather conditions associated with accidents.

2️⃣ Time-Based Analysis

Analyzed accident frequency by hour of the day to detect peak accident times.

3️⃣ Severity Distribution

Examined accident severity levels and their frequency.

4️⃣ Geographic Hotspot Visualization

Plotted accident locations using latitude and longitude to identify high-density regions.

🔍 Key Insights

Accidents are more frequent during peak traffic hours.

Certain weather conditions significantly increase accident occurrence.

Urban areas show higher accident density.

Higher severity levels are often linked to adverse environmental conditions.

📈 Conclusion

The analysis revealed important patterns in traffic accidents related to environmental and temporal factors. Visualizations helped identify accident hotspots and high-risk conditions, which can assist in developing road safety strategies and preventive measures.
